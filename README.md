I'm an Electrical Engineer by education. I like learning, exploring new things, and solving problems. I built this repository to start putting my utilities and projects instead of keeping them hidden on my home network. 
My experience includes single-board computer development, including hardware (schematics, layout, bring-up), enclosure design, firmware, and documentation. The product was used to control fuel injection on a four-cylinder engine.
I have worked on many projects over time that were not part of any job title. The largest project was a charity auction system to manage gifts, baskets, and live auction bidding capture. To make checkout faster, I created a credit
card number capture and secure storage. Checkout involved the bidder providing their number and the system printing a receipt of their purchases.
Most of my professional experience is with computer hardware. Beyond simply Wintel, I have experience with battery power and SSD storage.  Contact me if you want to get more details.

Some of the repositories will be related to things I write about in my books or blogs.
