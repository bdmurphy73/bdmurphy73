I'm an Electrical Engineer by education. I like learning and exploring new things and solving problems. I built this repository to start putting my utilities and projects instead of keeping them hidden on my home network. 
Some of the repositories will be related to things I write about in my books or blogs.

My first book talks about hacking and coding if your interested. https://books2read.com/u/ml8z0W
